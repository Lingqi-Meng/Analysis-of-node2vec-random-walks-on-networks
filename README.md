# Analysis of node2vec random walks on networks

## Fig.2 creation in the main text

Select `Spectral gap analysis.ipynb` to evaluate and plot the spectral gap for the node2vec random walks on empirical networks. The vole network is used in the cell [2] of `Spectral gap analysis.ipynb`

* One can download the data set from [Network Repository](http://networkrepository.com/). To save reader's time, we present the hyperlinks for our data set.

[Vole](http://networkrepository.com/mammalia-voles-bhp-trapping-55.php), [Dolphin](http://networkrepository.com/dolphins.php), [Enron](http://networkrepository.com/email-enron-only.php), [Jazz](http://networkrepository.com/jazz.php), [Coauthorship](http://networkrepository.com/ca-netscience.php), [Email](http://networkrepository.com/email-univ.php)

* If you need to consider a different network data set (other than the [Vole](http://networkrepository.com/mammalia-voles-bhp-trapping-55.php) network), you can

Step 1. download the empirical data set from the hyperlink above or some other sources.

Step 2. Replace the code in the cell [2] by your target data set. 

Step 3. Restart the kernel in Jupyter notebook.
